In this project, I developed an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard to analyze eCommerce sales data. This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of various aspects of the business, aiding in data-driven decision-making. Below is a detailed summary of the project:

Key Features and Insights:
1.Profit Analysis:
Monthly Profit Trends: A line chart illustrating the profit trends over each month, helping to identify peak and low-profit periods.
Profit by Sub-Category: A bar chart showcasing profits across different product sub-categories such as Printers, Bookcases, Saree, Accessories, and Tables, enabling the identification of high and low-profit items.

2.Sales and Quantity Analysis:
Sales Amount by State: A bar chart depicting sales amounts across various states (Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi), allowing for regional sales performance comparison.
Quantity Sold by Category: A pie chart representing the proportion of quantities sold across different categories, providing insights into product category popularity.
Quantity Sold by Payment Mode: A breakdown of quantities sold through different payment methods, helping to understand customer payment preferences.

3.Customer Insights:
Sales by Customer Name: A bar chart visualizing sales amounts attributed to individual customers, highlighting key customers contributing to revenue.

Metrics Displayed:
•	Total Sales Amount: 438K
•	Total Quantity Sold: 5615 units
•	Total Profit: 37K
•	Average Order Value (AOV): 121K

Steps Taken:
1.Data Preparation:
Cleaned and structured CSV files containing Order ID, Product ID, Customer ID, Order Date, Sales Amount, and Quantity.

2.Data Import and Transformation:
Imported data into Power BI using the 'Get Data' feature.
Utilized Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.
Established relationships between tables to create a cohesive dataset.

3.Measures and Visualizations:
Created key measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for essential metrics like Total Sales and Average Order Value.
Developed various visualizations including line charts, bar charts, and pie charts to represent data insights effectively.

4.Publishing and Sharing:
Published the completed dashboard to the Power BI service.
Shared the dashboard with stakeholders and set up scheduled data refreshes for continuous updates.

This project demonstrates my ability to handle data effectively, create meaningful visualizations, and provide actionable insights using Power BI. It showcases my skills in data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio and GitHub repository.
